# Notes from Math 104 (Real Analysis) at UC Berkeley

This repo contains notes from the Spring 2018 iteration of Math 104 at UC Berkeley taught by Professor Alan Hammond.

Unfortunately, my original batch of notes latex notes disappeared when my computer crashed over college. I recreated the notes over the Covid period. The structure unfortunately is slightly rough due to time constraints.
